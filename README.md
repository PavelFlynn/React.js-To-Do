## To Do List

This project is still in development as part of the React.js learning curve. For now, tech I'm using:

- React.js / JS: [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/).
- Styles: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- UI: [MUI](https://mui.com/).

Deployment: https://todopavel.netlify.app

> Note: Responsive design and Dark mode in progress...
